# LIRI Node App

* LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface built with Node.js.  LIRI will take user input from a series of possible commands and return the desired information.

* Possible LIRI commands are currently "Find a concert," "Find a song," and "Find a movie," along with a command of
"Do what it says" which reads a txt file and performs the action listed there.

* LIRI utilizes various packages and APIs including Inquirer, Axios, Spotify,
moment, and FS.  LIRI also calls Colors in order to make the interface more user-friendly.

* Additional features of LIRI: recursive; logs all searches and results to an external log.txt file.

* One of the best features of LIRI is it's scalability.  LIRI can remain how it is and be a fully-fuctional and neat little app with a pleasing UI, but with a few new prompts and cases, LIRI's capabilities can be greatly (and easily!) expanded.
